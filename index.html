<font face="capita" size="5">
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unexpected stresses on food systems, creating many immediate challenges. Yet what is remarkable is the speed with which supply chain actors have to date been able to reorganise themselves to ensure the continued availability of food
 at least in the developed world. Some bottlenecks remain, and some new disruptions may emerge as COVID-19 continues to spread.
 The rapid response of food supply chains has underscored the importance of an open and predictable international trading environment
 which allows firms to tap into new sources of supply when existing sources are compromised. Policy makers have also so far mostly avoided the mistakes made during the food price crisis of 2007-8
 and have also taken a range of other steps which have helped ensure the continued functioning of food supply chains.</p>
